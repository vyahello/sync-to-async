# Synchronous to Asynchronous code base

> Describes how we could optimize our python code based on built-in asynchronous approach.

## Tools

### Production
- python 3.6 +
- asyncIO

### Development

- [travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
- [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)
- [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [mypy](http://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
- [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)

### Quick start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vyahello/sync-to-async.git
python demo/async.py  # asynchronous sample
```

## Development notes

### Testing

Generally, `pytest` tool is used to organize testing procedure.

Please follow next command to run unittests:
```bash
pytest
```

### CI

Project has Travis CI integration using [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) file thus code analysis (`black`, `flake8`, `mypy`).

To be able to run code analysis, please execute command below:
```bash
./analyse-source-code.sh
```
